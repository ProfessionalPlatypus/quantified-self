					<description><![CDATA[Dear Sir, Madam,
I am very much interested in the paper of Ulfried Reichard &quot;Control, the Quantified Self-Movement, and Contemporary Fiction: Zero and The Circle”. I am PhD and will give a lecture about the quantified self next week, which I will link to &#039;The Circle&#039;. Could you send me more information (the paper perhaps) or send him my contact details so he can contact me?
Many thanks in advance.
Best, Tim]]></description>
