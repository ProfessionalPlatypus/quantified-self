The inscription of our lives through the \u201cdigital exhausts\u201d we produce as part of our everyday existence are a new form of writing about the self. While there have long been administrative data and records about us which influence how we are interpreted by others; self-tracking and other devices are enabling us to take an active role in the production of our \u201cdigital doubles\u201d. Data from self-tracking sources are arguably inherently communicative both because they produce content which can be shared by users (in the form of statistics and GPS maps) and because they are networked and always delivering information to other users and corporate or other entities. But do these developments enable us to construct our own identities through data or enable others to control us? William Burroughs famously suggested that language is a virus which structures perception and asserts control. Following Felix Guattari we can see how the language, code and systems which underlie all digital objects function as \u201casignifying semiotics\u201d, that is, symbolic phenomena which do not directly signify the world but function as control systems which are all the more powerful for not be recognised as such. Self-tracking systems enable the transmission of this viral control into our corporeality by using \u201cnudge\u201d based systems of behaviour change with the aim of creating \u201cautomatic subjects\u201d who simply respond to stimuli in the desired fashion. We must therefore see the sociotechnical assemblages enabled by mobile tracking devices as \u201cbiopolitical\u201d and \u201cpsycho political\u201d interventions. While users potentially benefit from the development of healthier and more productive lifestyle regimes they are also being physically and psychologically reshaped to be more efficient cogs in the semiotic machinery of capitalism. Knowledge, data and semiotic driven production requires affective as well as material and immaterial labour necessitating efficient channelling of physical and psychic energy in order to remain productive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>30 Sep, 2017<\/h4>\n<h3>Key Note<\/h3>\n<p>Marie-Luise Angerer, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>SENSING: The Knowledge of Sensitive (Affective) Data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today environment, technology, and humans are linked through their capacity for sensation.
