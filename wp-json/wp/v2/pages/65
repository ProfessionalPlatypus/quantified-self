In fact, the quantification movement \u00a0did actually start in the US and it has lately found its way to Germany \u2013 along with an entire spectrum of smartwatches, calorie-trackers and step-counting apps. The phenomenon of self-observation itself, however, is not new. \u201cSelf-quantification first appears in the literature of the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century. In Benjamin Franklin\u2019s diary, for example, detailed lists of guidelines he wanted to follow can be found,\u201d says Prof. Dr. Ulfried Reichardt, Chair of the Department of North American Studies and leader of the research project. \u201cThis phenomenon has long been a part of American culture. What has changed is how people use it \u2013 most importantly through the rise of smartphones and social media.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Ich-messe-also-bin-ich2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-344 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Ich-messe-also-bin-ich2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Ich-messe-also-bin-ich2.jpg 200w, http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Ich-messe-also-bin-ich2-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a>The German Research Foundation is supporting the project <em>Probing the Limits of the Quantified Self <\/em>with \u20ac170,000. Dr. Regina Schober, a literary scholar from Mannheim is analyzing how contemporary American literature and film deal with self-tracking. In these texts, the main focus is on topics such as data abuse and surveillance. They tell stories of protagonists who lose their autonomy and privacy through voluntary self-control. \u201cIn the past, the rational confrontation with the self was depicted as positive. Contemporary literature, however, is very critical towards self-quantification. Today\u2019s technological opportunities are put in an experimental field where all their negative consequences are thought through to the end. In addition, our value system is being questioned as it forces us to continuously improve ourselves,\u201d says Regina Schober.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the smartphone, which can only provide numbers and algorithms, literature affords us insights into an individual\u2019s thoughts and feelings. \u201cTexts hint at the proper ethical and moral handling of self-quantification \u2013 something that a purely scientific or technological approach cannot deliver,\u201d Regina Schober explains. \u201cOur goal is to make a diagnosis of the cultural debates that have led to this self-tracking phenomenon. We want to look at how a culture \u2013 and in this case the American culture \u2013 deals with it.\u201d The project is planned for the next three years.<\/p>\n<p><em>Original post by Nadine Diehl and Stefanie Eichler<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><em>Translation by Marie-Luis Rothenberger<\/em><\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.uni-mannheim.de\/ionas\/uni\/forum\/forschung\/Ausgabe%201-2016\/Ich%20messe,%20also%20bin%20ich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89 noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-104\" src=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/forum_magazin-interview.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"442\" height=\"608\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I quantify, therefore I am?
