In his dissertation, entitled <em>The Specter of Posthumanism \u2013 Conceptions of Autonomy and Agency in American Literary Representations<\/em>, he utilizes the contemporary theories from the field of critical posthumanism, systems theory, actor-network theory, and object ontology to devise a perspective for the rereading of established literary genres and canonical literature with a posthumanist perspective. Further research projects and essays concern monster theory, realism and naturalism as well as transhumanism. As part of the DFG research group <em>Probing the Limits of the Quantified Self: Human Agency and Knowledge in Literature and Culture of the Information Age<\/em>, he works on analyzing the impact of quantification technologies on the possibilities, limitations, and modifications of the body in science fiction literature of the 20th and 21st century. The central question is how the notion of the quantified self and its technoscientific innovations change the way human life and embodiment are envisioned and negotiated and whether or not the reliance on quantification also pushes mankind closer to a state of posthumanity.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-328 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"119\" height=\"162\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto.jpg 517w, http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto-222x300.jpg 222w, http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto-281x380.jpg 281w, http:\/\/quantified-self.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/bewerbungsfoto-406x550.jpg 406w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" \/><\/a>Marie-Luis Rothenberger<\/strong>\u00a0is the research assistant for this project.\u00a0In 2015, she finished her bachelor in English Studies\u00a0at the University of Mannheim.
